\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Most articles that deal with Virtual Network Embedding focus on finding suboptimal solutions in a timely fashion. Hence, there is but a few theoretical results in the literature. The goal of the current research is to further the theoretical understanding of the VNEP.

This report presented a simplified version of the Virtual Network Embedding Problem. The State of the Art was evaluated with an emphasis on exact methods or heuristic approaches that can guide exact methods. Two integer linear programming models were presented. Lower bounds were presented.

The following future research directions are highlighted:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Theoretical results on the VNEP time complexity.
  \item New lower bounds and cuts on linear programming models.
  \item Generation of more realistic instances and a improvement on the understanding of the characteristics of the instances.
  \item A specialized branch \& bound algorithm.
  \item A column generation method coupled with a branch \& bound to solve the path-based formulation of the VNEP.
\end{itemize}
