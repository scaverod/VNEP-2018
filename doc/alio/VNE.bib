@article{Fajjari2011,
abstract = {In this paper, we address a virtual network embedding problem. Indeed, our objective is to map virtual networks in the substrate network with minimum physical resources while satisfying its required QoS in terms of bandwidth, power processing and memory. In doing so, we minimize the reject rate of requests and maximize returns for the substrate network provider. Since the problem is NP-hard and to deal with its computational hardness, we propound a new scalable embedding strategy named textttVNE-AC based on the Ant Colony metaheuristic. The intensive simulations and evaluation results show that our proposal enhances the substrate provider's revenue and outperforms the related strategies found in current literature.},

abstract = {Waste of energy due to over-provisioning and over-dimensioning of network infrastructures has recently stimulated the interest on energy consumption reduction by Internet Service Providers (ISPs). By means of resource consolidation, network virtualization based architectures will enable energy saving. In this letter, we extend the well-known virtual network embedding problem (VNE) to energy awareness and propose a mixed integer program (MIP) which provides optimal energy efficient embeddings. Simulation results show the energy gains of the proposed MIP over the existing cost-based VNE approach.},

abstract = {Due to the existence of multiple stakeholders with conflicting goals and policies, alterations to the existing Internet architecture are now limited to simple incremental updates; deployment of any new, radically different technology is next to impossible. To fend off this ossification, network virtualization has been propounded as a diversifying attribute of the future inter-networking paradigm. By introducing a plurality of heterogeneous network architectures cohabiting on a shared physical substrate, network virtualization promotes innovations and diversified applications. In this paper, we survey the existing technologies and a wide array of past and state-of-the-art projects on network virtualization followed by a discussion of major challenges in this area.},

abstract = {This paper presents Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulations to optimally allocate Virtual Optical Networks (VONs) over a transparent optical network substrate. These formulations serve the purpose of building either completely transparent VONs or opaque ones, where electrical termination capabilities are assumed at each virtual network node. In addition, a lightweight Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search (GRASP) heuristic is provided for the transparent case. The obtained results validate the accuracy of the proposed heuristic and reveal the benefits of the presented solutions against simpler shortest-path-based VON allocation strategies.},

@article{Yu2008,
abstract = {Network virtualization is a powerful way to run multiple architectures or experiments simultaneously on a shared in- frastructure. However, making efficient use of the underlying resources requires effective techniques for virtual network embeddingmapping each virtual network to specific nodes and links in the substrate network. Since the general embed- ding problem is computationally intractable, past research restricted the problem space to allow efficient solutions, or focused on designing heuristic algorithms. In this paper, we advocate a different approach: rethinking the design of the substrate network to enable simpler embedding algorithms and more efficient use of resources, without restricting the problem space. In particular, we simplify virtual link em- bedding by: i) allowing the substrate network to split a virtual link over multiple substrate paths and ii) employing path migration to periodically re-optimize the utilization of the substrate network. We also explore node-mapping al- gorithms that are customized to common classes of virtual- network topologies. Our simulation experiments show that path splitting, path migration, and customized embedding algorithms enable a substrate network to satisfy a much larger mix of virtual networks.},
